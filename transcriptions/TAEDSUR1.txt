Firman granted by SHAH AURUNGZEB to the Hon’ble East India Company, dated the 25th June 1667.
Be it known to the Governor, Prefects, and Officers of Affairs of the Port of Surat, present and to come, conﬁding in our Royal favor, that at this pre-sent time, joined to happiness, certain notice is come to our ears, that whereas formerly the rate for Customs of goods belonging to the merchants of the Dutch nation was on every hundred Rupees three and a half Rupees, and afterwards, having an eye to the proﬁtable condition of the said people, two Rupees was only ordered; and whereas the merchants of the English nation have made their request that the rates for the Customs of their goods may be confirmed according to the Dutch constitution, and that a Firman may pass from our excellent and noble Court that the goods and merchandizes which the said merchants, having bought in Bengal, and in the Royal seat of our kingdom, Akburabad, and other countries and great cities, do transport by the way of Burhanpoor and Ahmedabad, to sell them in the Bundur of Surat, may not be stopped by any person in their passage, on pretence of taking Rahadarees or other Duties, or on any prohibition whatsoever; and in case any of the goods belonging to the aforesaid persons be robbed in the way, that the Officers and Guards of the said place do, in the recovery of the said goods, make all diligent search ; and whereas a petition was directed to our exalted Throne, upon the sight of a letter which Ghyas-ood-deen-Khan, Governor of Surat, hath written unto the trusty protector of our riches, the repose and glory of our kingdom, the pillar of our Councillors, emblems of honor, the flower of our Princes, high in dignity, the provident disposer of our kingdoms and estates, the open way to riches and plenty, worthy of all grace, a re-warder of all degrees of men, a Lord of pity, the mark of felicity, Chancellor of our kingdoms, and sole manager of our affairs, Jafer Khan, to this effect, that in case any favor be shown to the English nation, (who are well-wishers to the riches of our Court, by their services which they have performed to our beneﬁt have so approved themselves formerly and hitherto in an obliging manner,) it will be well deserved by them ; and whereas the instant desire of our mind, known in truth, and the perfection of our heart, established in justice, is expended on the quiet state and universal beneﬁt of all people, at the agreeable petition of the merchants of the English nation, having forgiven them one Ru-pee of the sum of three Rupees, (the accustomary duties of their goods,) I have now ordered them to pay but two Rupees; therefore, from this time forward on every hundred Rupees Value of goods belonging to the English nation, two Rupees must be taken in the aforesaid Bundur; and the Governors, Captains of Guards, Lieutenants of countries, Guards of passes and the highways of the provinces and great cities aforesaid, shall not give any molestation or opposi-tion to the aforesaid merchants on pretence of Rahadarees or other demands whatsoever, which are prohibited in our Court and high Palace ; and in case in any place the least part of their goods or merchandize be stolen, that in the recovery of them all strict search and inquiry be made, and the thieves, toge-ther with the goods stolen, being apprehended, the goods may be delivered to the owners, and the thieves to punishment. In this affair let them observe all extraordinary diligence towards our Court, and be very circumspect and cau-tious to abstain from the breach hereof.
Written the 11th day of Mohurrum, in the tenth year of Our High Reign, (cor-responding with the 25th June 1667, A. D.)
