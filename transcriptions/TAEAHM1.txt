TRANSLATION of a Paper addressed to CAPTAIN OUTRAM, Acting Political Agent, Mahee Kanta, by MAHARAJ PRITHEE SINGJEE KURUMSINGJEE.
In your letter to me dated 18th February 1836, you informed me that it was the intention of the British Government to restore my Throne and Kingdom to me if I would subscribe to certain Conditions therein enumerated : to these conditions I agree, as follows :-
1.I will abide by the same Agreement that was entered into in 1812* with the British Government.
2.From this time forward neither I, nor my children, nor my posterity, will perform the ceremony of Suttee.
3.I will appoint a respectable and active Minister to manage the business of my State, subject to the approval of the British Government.
4.I will pay my Ghansdana, and any balance that may be due to His Highness the Gaekwar through my Nishadar, Oomedsing Barot, of Puntun, and in future I will continue my Nisha as heretofore.
5.The expenses of individuals confined at Sadra on account of the Suttee shall be defrayed by me.
6.I will retain no Arabs, Muranees, Purdesees, or others, whether horse or foot, except those that are old servants of my house.
7.If there should be any quarrel between any of my Thakoors and any village, I will make known the same to the Political Agent, and as he shall advise so will I do.
8.I will not attack the Thakoor of any village without the permission of the Political Agent.
