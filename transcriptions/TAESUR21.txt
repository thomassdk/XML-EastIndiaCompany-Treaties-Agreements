SURAT 801
PROCLAMATION,
BY THE HON’BLE JONATHAN DUNCAN, GOVERNOR OF BOMBAY.
DATED SURAT, THE 15TH MAY 1800._____
Whereas by a Treaty concluded between the Hon’ble English Company and the Nuwab Meer Nuseer-ood-Deen Khan, under the date the 13th May 1800, or the 19th of Zilhuj 1214 of the Hijree, the said Nuwab has agreed that the management and collection of the Revenues of the City of Surat, and of the Territories, Places, and other Dependencies thereof, the administration of civil and criminal justice, and generally the entire government of the said City and its Dependencies, hall be vested forever, wholly and exclusively in the Hon’ble English Company;
This is therefore to give notice to all the inhabitants of the Town of Surat and its Dependencies, that the Hon’ble Company’s exclusive Government commences from this day, being Thursday, the 15th of May 1800. Or the 221st of Zilhuj 1214 of the Hijree.  All persons now in civil offices are to continue to act under the administration of the Hon’ble Company until further or-ders, and under their future permanency will, of course, in a great measure, depend, under the good pleasure of Government, upon their diligence in their several trusts, and their fidelity to the English Sirkar.
Edward Galley, Esquire, has been appointed Collector of the Mokats and Mogalee of the Purgunas, and Alexander Ramsay, Esquire, Judge and Magistrate of the city.  The Natives in trust in these Departments are therefore respectively to continue to act in subordination to those superior Officers, and such appointments or regulations as may take place will be announced in a few days, it being sufficient for the present to intimate to all the Company’s New Subjects of Surat, that the motives and object of the British Government in taking on themselves the full and entire government of Surat, have been, and are, to procure thereby a just, wise, and efficient administration for the security of the lives and properties, and the promotion of the happiness of all its inhabitants, of which, with God’s blessing, the good effects may soon be rendered manifest.
