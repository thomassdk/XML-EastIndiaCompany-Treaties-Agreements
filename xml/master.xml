                        have liberty to buy; and I further order, that should their goods not be

                        on them, nor on any provisions (such as cattle, goats, &amp;c.
                        provi-sions) which they may provide at <unknown transliteration="true"

                        maintenance. They are also not to demand any thing for their gardens, nor in
                        any shape molest their Gardeners’ boats, vessels, &amp;c., conveyances,
                        or send them on any <unknown transliteration="true">Sirkar</unknown>’s

                        being contrary to our rules; and in short no one must presume to make any
                        new Custom to their prejudice, by any former Rules or rates, or in any shape
                        put any affront on them and their people; they have also free liberty to
                        provide any sort of grain, and sell the same, and any Europe goods, at any
                        rate they please. The Customs on the <unknown transliteration="true"
