Individual unique ID's were created to mark individual doucments with the source material.
 
They were created in 3 distinct parts:

1: The first is an an acronym of the first 3 letters in the title of the source book (Treaties, Agreements and Engagements) = TAE
	(This is to allow future studies that may want to target treaties across a range of source materials.

2: The second is the first 3 letters of the documents index from the source material. This index is organised by area and in alphabetical order. 
	eg. AHMEDNUGGUR = AHM

3: The third is the number of the document within its index.
	eg. 1

So the complete ID for the first document within the source material is 	TAE-AHM-1 	
	(The hypens are used here to show the example in the files the final ID would = TAEAHM1)
